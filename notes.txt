Files under plugin/..... are automaticly executed at start up

Files under lua/..... nead a requier ("file_name") to be executed

You can also take advantage of the lua modules struture ex:
  Let's say that the file exisit lua/super-plugin/init.lua
  Doing a requier ("super-plugin") will call the init.lua file

To reload a file that has been requier do (package representes a folder)
lua package.loaded["package.file"] = nil
